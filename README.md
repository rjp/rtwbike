# rtwbike - experiments in Eddington numbers

[Stuart Lowe][rtwbike] is going around the world on his bike.

This code groks his 'GPS log' updates and calculates his Eddington Number in a clunky fashion.

It's all very hairy and ad-hoc but it's slowly moving to a sensible set of scripts, etc.

(The HTML templating is done with DOM manipulation; inspired by ['spaghetti code'][spagcode] and facilitated by [BeautifulSoup][bs4].)
